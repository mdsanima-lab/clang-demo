# Example

Here are some example projects that you can use to learn more about **C** and **C++** base code and the **CMake** build system.

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check out the technical documentation of each project, which can be found in the _README_ files. It's very important!

Example projects:

- The sample [`mdsanima-awesome`](./mdsanima-awesome/README.md) project is written in **C** language, and the source code file extension is in `.c` format.
- The sample [`mdsanima-fantastic`](./mdsanima-fantastic/README.md) project is written in **C++** language, and the source code file extension is in `.cc` format.
- The sample [`mdsanima-remarkable`](./mdsanima-remarkable/README.md) project is written in **C++** language, and the source code file extension is in `.cpp` format.

All projects are the same, they only differ in the text displayed in the terminal and in other file extensions.
